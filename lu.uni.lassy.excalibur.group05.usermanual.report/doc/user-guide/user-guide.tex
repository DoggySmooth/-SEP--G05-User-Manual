\chapter{Usage Guide}
\label{chap:usage_guide}

This section is aimed at describing the general use of the software. Such
information is grouped by the different kinds of actors.
Such actors are expected to use the software to perform some
processes or workflows (called here procedures) using the concerned software
\textbf{(including installation procedures)}.

The description of the processes should be organised to facilitate learning by
presenting simpler, more common, or initial processes before more complex, less
utilised, or subsequent processes.

Common procedures should be presented once to avoid redundancy when they are
used in more complex procedures. 

Each process has to be documented using the following use-case textual description
template \cite{armour01usecase} \textbf{BUT its content must be as low level as possible with actual values}:

\item [\textbf{Primary Actor}:] Coordinator John
\item [\textbf{Secondary Actor}:] FirstAidWorker Bob,\\
                  ExternalResourceSystem (ERS)
\item [\textbf{Intention:}]The intention of the Coordinator is to process mission with ID equal to 1.

1. \emph{John} instructs the \emph{CMS} to process a specific mission.\\
2. \emph{CMS} selects the internal worker \emph{Bob} to execute the mission.\\
3. \emph{CMS} instructs `\emph{Bob} to behave as \emph{FAW}.\\
4. \emph{Bob} informs to the \emph{CMS} of his arrival.\\
5. \emph{Bob} executes the mission.\\
6. \emph{Bob} informs to the \emph{CMS} the mission outcome.


\item [\textbf{Extensions}]:\\
2.a None internal worker can execute the mission.\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} 2.a.1 \emph{CMS} requests an external resource to \emph{ERS}.\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} 2.a.2 \emph{ERS} informs \emph{CMS} that the request can be processed.\\

different stages of the process while its is performed by the actor.



\section{Actors common procedures}
Common procedures to several actors are grouped in this section to avoid
redundancy.

\subsection{Trigger the alert state}

\begin{lyxlist}{UC1}
\small{
\item [\textbf{Use~Case:}] TriggerAlertState
\item [\textbf{Scope:}] Crisis Management System (\emph{CMS})
\item [\textbf{Primary Actor}:] Medical Department, Military Department,
Government
\item [\textbf{Secondary Actor}:] None
\item [\textbf{Intention:}] According to the diagnostic or decision of one of
the primary actors, an alert will will send a notification to SHeavy about a
possible epidemic.
\item [\textbf{Level}:]Subfunctional level
\item [\textbf{Main~Success~Scenario}]:\\
1. Medical Department finds out that an epidemic is possible. They will
immediately send a confirmed notification to SHeavy.\\
2. Military Department finds out that an epidemic is possible. They will
immediately send a confirmed notification to SHeavy.\\
3. The Government finds out that an epidemic is possible. They will
immediately send a confirmed notification to SHeavy.\\

\subsection{Lift the alert state}

\item [\textbf{Use~Case:}] LiftAlertState

\item [\textbf{Primary Actor}:] Medical Department, Military Department,
Government
\item [\textbf{Secondary Actor}:] None
\item [\textbf{Intention:}] According to the diagnostic or decision of one of
the primary actors, an alert will will send a notification to SHeavy about a
possible epidemic.
\item [\textbf{Level}:]Subfunctional level
\item [\textbf{Main~Success~Scenario}]:\\
1. Medical Department notices that the epidemic is over or that the
diagnostic was not right. They will immediately send a notification to SHeavy
to lift the alert.\\
2. Military Department finds out that an epidemic is over or that their
information was not right. They will immediately send a notification to SHeavy
to lift the alert.\\
3. The Government finds out that an epidemic is over or that their
information was not right. They will immediately send a notification to SHeavy
to lift the alert.\\
4. The system will automatically lift the pre-alert if the alert notification
was not confirmed. For example due to a misclick or misfunction of the system.\\

\subsection{Handling of infected patient}

\begin{lyxlist}{UC1}
\small{
\item [\textbf{Use~Case:}] HandlingOfInfectedPatient
\item [\textbf{Scope:}] Crisis Management System (\emph{CMS})
\item [\textbf{Primary Actor}:] Medical Department
\item [\textbf{Secondary Actor}:] None
\item [\textbf{Intention:}]The Medical Department intends to update
the application with the newest data about infected people, no matter what
sickness they have. In case of a known epidemic infection, keep an updated
record of the growth of the epidemic.
\item [\textbf{Level}:]Subfunctional level
\item [\textbf{Main~Success~Scenario}]:\\
1. The Medical Department performs a medical check on a patient.\\
2. The Medical Department sends data about that patient to the application.\\
3. If the patient shows signs of an infection that is an already known epidemic infection, his data
and location will be automatically updated on the data center part dedicated to
this matter and also notify on SHeavy.\\
4. If the patient shows signs of an unknown infection the medical Department
will proceed on taking a sample of blood for further testing.\\
5. The Medical sends the sample to the nearest laboratory in order to find a
cure.\\
