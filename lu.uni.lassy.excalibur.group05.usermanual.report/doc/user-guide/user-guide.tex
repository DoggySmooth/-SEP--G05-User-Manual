\chapter{Usage Guide}
\label{chap:usage_guide}

This section is aimed at describing the general use of the software. Such
information is grouped by the different kinds of actors.
Such actors are expected to use the software to perform some
processes or workflows (called here procedures) using the concerned software
\textbf{(including installation procedures)}.

\section{Actors common procedures}
Common procedures to several actors are grouped in this section to avoid
redundancy.
